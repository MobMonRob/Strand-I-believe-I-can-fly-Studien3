General Hints:
`command` 	= command to execute in bash
'directory' 	= path to directory
<placeholder> 	= placeholder for specific path, NOT the actual path!

Important links for development:
- AirSim Repository & "Documentation": 	https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim
- ROS Kinetic Wiki: 			http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic
- OpenCV Documentation: 		https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/index.html

Requirements:
- Update Ubuntu via `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`
- Make sure Python 3 is installed. Type `python3 --version` into bash.

- Install ROS Kinetic, see http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
- Install OpenCV for Python 3 including extended library (contrib package), `pip3 install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python`
- Test webcam. `sudo apt-get install cheese`, `cheese` should show webcam feed. In case webcam can't be found by cheese check if webcam is disabled via keyboard. (MSI Laptop: FN + F6)
- Install OpenPose until step 'OpenPose Configuration' (excluding this step), see https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation.md
- Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` at <openpose root directory>
- Continue with 'OpenPose Configuration', make sure to check BUILD_PYTHON in CMake-GUI
- Run `sudo make install` at '<openpose root directory>/build/python'
- Install dependencies for ROS Python modules via `pip3 install matplotlib scikit-fuzzy`
