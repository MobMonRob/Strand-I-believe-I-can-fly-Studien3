Installation instructions for Ubuntu 16.04 with ROS Kinetic and AirSim

General Hints:
`command` 	= command to execute in bash
'directory' 	= path to directory
<placeholder> 	= placeholder for specific path, NOT the actual path!

Important links for development:
- AirSim Repository & "Documentation": 	https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim
- ROS Kinetic Wiki: 			http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic
- OpenCV Documentation: 		https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/index.html

Requirements:
- Update Ubuntu via `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`
- Make sure Python 3 is installed. Type `python3 --version` into bash.
- Make sure Pip3 (package manager for Python) is installed. Type `pip3` into bash, pip help should show up. Otherwise install it via `sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip`.

Installation:
- Install AirSim & Unreal Engine, see https://github.com/Microsoft/AirSim/blob/master/docs/build_linux.md
- Install ROS Kinetic, see http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic/Installation/Ubuntu
- Install OpenCV for Python 3 including extended library (contrib package), `pip3 install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python`
- Test webcam. `sudo apt-get install cheese`, `cheese` should show webcam feed. In case webcam can't be found by cheese check if webcam is disabled via keyboard. (MSI Laptop: FN + F6)
- Install OpenPose until step 'OpenPose Configuration' (excluding this step), see https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation.md
- Run `git submodule init && git submodule update` at <openpose root directory>
- Continue with 'OpenPose Configuration', make sure to check BUILD_PYTHON in CMake-GUI
- Run `sudo make install` at '<openpose root directory>/build/python'
- Install dependencies for ROS Python modules via `pip3 install matplotlib scikit-fuzzy`
- Install the mbientlab metawear API. To do this, see https://mbientlab.com/tutorials/PyLinux.html. The "Installation" chapter is misleading. The real installation of metawear is described in the chapter "MetaWear". Also consider the "Dependencies" chapter. Please also take a look here (https://github.com/mbientlab/MetaWear-SDK-Python) if you have problems installing metawear.
